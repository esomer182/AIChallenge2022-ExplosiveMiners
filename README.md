# AI-Challenge-2022---Explosive-miners

I will only **briefly** describe the idea. You can read about the game here: https://www.coliseum.ai/material?lang=en&tournament=explosiveminers

## Idea:
During the first round my strategy focuses on creating a lot of miners from the start to collect resources early. Then, on the middle game, I try to code as many soldiers as possible to protect the miners and the HQ, finally towards the late game I switch to miners again, this time to create an army of explosive miners. Lastly, from the thousandth round onwards, I use the resources to buy victory points.

The miners explode if at any point they kill enemy troops with more value than the friendly troops it is killing (itself plus possibily some other troops).

The soldiers turn into towers for the late game, forming a wall-like structure near the HQ.
